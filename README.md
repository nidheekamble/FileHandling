Maintainer: Ms. Nidhee Kamble (nidheekamble)

INTENTION
---------

### *If you cannot explain it simply, you do not understand it well enough.* - Albert Einstein

Learning should be an interesting and memorable experience, not a chore. I believe that the true meaning of knowledge lies in spraeding it, and these are/were my efforts to do the same. I hope that the readers and/or consumers of this repository, irrespective of their backgrounds, find it to be significantly catalysing in invoking their passion for the topic.

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Both the folders have the presentations and programs for the respective languages. <br>
In addition to the program(s), the C folder also contains a PDF which is a manifestation of my effort to adequately but appropriately condense the topic in the most lucid way that I could. <br>

I welcome feedback (good and bad both) and suggestions at kamble.nidhee@gmail.com.


Hope you have a great time.
